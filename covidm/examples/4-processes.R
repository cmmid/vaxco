# what the above does.
# this says to set up an observation process. Individuals enter the process when they *leave* compartment [source].
# So e.g. if you want to track symptomatics (e.g. to track burdens) you should set source = "Is".
# When individuals enter this process, they get split (that's the type = "multinomial" bit -- only thing implemented so far) into
# two subprocesses, test1 and test2. prob is a [number of subprocesses] x [number of age groups] matrix with age-specific probabilities of
# entering either the "test1" or "test2" subprocess. These are unnormalised weights actually, so you can't just leave one blank at the moment.
# report = "ipo" means report the incidence, prevalence, and "outcidence" of individuals in the subprocesses. Can just specify e.g. "p" or "ip" or whatever.
# delays is how long individuals stay in the subprocesses and is not split by age. So far I just have cm_delay_gamma (for a gamma distribution,
# with parameters mean, shape, max_t and t_step, which needs to be the same as the simulation's time step).
# You can chain these together by setting the source of another process to one of the names of the subprocesses.

# run the model + combine multisource processes
run = cm_process_consolidate(cm_simulate(params))

# show results

    geom_line(aes(t, value, colour = group, group = group)) + 
    facet_wrap(~compartment, scales = "free_y")
